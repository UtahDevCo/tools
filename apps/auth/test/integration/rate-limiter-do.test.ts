 * Integration tests for RateLimiterDO
 *
 * NOTE: These tests are skipped because they require direct Durable Object access.
 * Durable Objects can only be tested via:
 * 1. Vitest with @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers, OR
 * 2. E2E tests against a deployed/local service (see test/e2e/)
 *
 * The E2E tests in test/e2e/ test the RateLimiterDO behavior indirectly through the auth API.
